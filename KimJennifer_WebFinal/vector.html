            <p> 
                This is my Illustrator Final Project. I made my startup companyâ€™s logo although I have not started the business yet. I just thought about my idea, but it was very useful for me to make it feel real. It was an amazing experience to be able to create my own brand logo that I thought only people with special expertise could create. And most of all, it was best to be able to express more efficiently and intuitively because I created the image of the business idea I was thinking through myself, not through a designer.
